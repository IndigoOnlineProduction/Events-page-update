### If the event features multiple authors/book covers/dates, simply copy the necessary sections and paste in the relevant information

### If the Event Info includes a list i.e.
```
Open Mic Guidelines:
- Local artist sign-up sheet will be available in store starting at 9am on the day of the event
- Each artist will have 2-3 minutes onstage
```
### Use this format and copy it within the "eventInfo" div below the last p tag
```
<strong>Open Mic Guidelines:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Local artist sign-up sheet will be available in store starting at 9am on the day of the event</li>
            <li>Each artist will have 2-3 minutes onstage</li>
          </ul>                  
```

### If the Event Info requires a button, e.g. "Buy Tickets" use this format and copy within the "eventInfo" div below the last element (likely a paragraph or list):
```
<p><a href="http://www.thebabyshows.com/toronto/spring/visitors/buy-tickets" target="_blank" class="allButton">buy tickets</a></p>
```

### Once the event has been updated, check in the changes then check all links for accuracy and ensure that the event is linking to the correct host store

### Send off to the Events team and give yourself a pat on the back!
